Notes for the Graph Coloring Survey Project

A simple plan of research would be to start with Andrew Radin thesis
https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/660/. 

First, update the last two
decades of work by others. 

Then do better and go beyond Andrew's thesis.
In addition to different algorithms, I would also consider families of
special graphs, like Payley or Mycielski graphs. How well heuristics
do on them?

- Add simulated annealing
- Add Radin's fitness function
- Graphs of >= 500 vertices for 30 graphs
- Add special types of graphs (Payley -- chi ~~ clique, Mycielski -- chi < clique)
- For random graphs: .5 and .85
- Graphs types: Random .5, Random .85, Payley, Mycielski

2 fitness function X 3 algorithms (PSO, DE, SA) X 4 graph types = 24 runs
